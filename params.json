The greyscale version makes it easier to see the values that are causing the rotation.\r\n- *Press 'S'* to save a screen cap. This only works on the executable version, not Processing.js \r\n- *Click the mouse* to cycle through different photos (coded only for two but easy to add more)\r\n- *Mouse over the image* to cause the tiles to spin a bit\r\n\r\nThe two photos used in the sketch are:\r\n- [Tiny car in Assisi](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sboyd/6237466147/in/set-72157627874124564)\r\n- [Rooftop of the CBC](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sboyd/4911046612/in/set-72157624671011581/)\r\n\r\nThe sketch currently runs under Processing v2.0b7. Processing is available from Processing.org\r\n\r\nThe sketch uses standard Processing methods (no special Java libs etc...) which means that it can be easily ported to Processing.js (http://processingjs.org/). Note, you'll want to add the @pjs directives to pre-load the images in Processing.js.\r\nYou can see this sketch running on Processing.js here, sspboyd.ca/perlin . \r\n\r\nStephen Boyd\r\n\r\n[@sspboyd](http://twitter.com/sspboyd)\r\n![Image of the Perlin Learning sketch in action][demoScreenShot2]\r\n\r\n[demoScreenShot1]:http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8267826055_c646b67d9e_c_d.jpg \"Image of the Perlin Learning sketch in action\"\r\n[demoScreenShot2]:http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8267829775_52a787fee2_c_d.jpg \"Image of the Perlin Learning sketch in action\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
